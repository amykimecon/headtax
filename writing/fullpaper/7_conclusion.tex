\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, I find evidence that the Chinese Head Tax of 1885 had significant effects on the inflow of Chinese immigrants to Canada, as well as effects on selection into migration and wealth accumulation. While there is still a great deal of room to refine the analysis done in this paper, and to further investigate mechanisms, I believe that the initial findings give some initial insight into possible effects of the head tax, and the possible implications for present-day immigration policy. Selection into migration is a topic of great interest, and bears significant relevance to present-day immigration policies, many of which explicitly approve immigrants based on educational background and economic standing. Understanding how immigration costs, whether explicit (as in the case of the head tax), or implicit (as in the case of modern-day immigration), play a role in selection into migration and outcomes after arrival, is key to understanding how to best shape policy going forward.
