author = {Simone Bertoli and Steven Stillman},
keywords = {Migration, Selection, Wages, Point-system, United States},
abstract = {Many destination countries consider implementing points-based migration systems as a way to improve migrants’ quality, but our understanding of the actual effects of selective policies is limited. We use data from the ACS 2001–2017 to analyze the overlap in the wage distribution of low- and high-educated recent migrants from different origins after controlling for other observable characteristics. When we randomly match a high- with a low-educated immigrant from the same country, more than one-quarter of time the low-educated immigrant has a higher hourly wage, notwithstanding a statistically significant difference in the mean wage of the two groups for most origins. For 98 out of 114 countries, this synthetic measure of the overlap in the two wage distributions stands above the corresponding figure for natives. We also find that at least 82% of the variance in log wages for migrants with a given number of years of schooling is due to differences within rather than across countries. This suggests that heavily relying on education to select immigrants might fail to markedly improve their quality.}

author = {Maria Forthun Hoen},
keywords = {Immigration, Earnings, Employment, Language requirements},
abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approach to estimating immigration impacts on natives’ labor market outcomes. Differential language requirements across occupations serve as an arguably exogenous source of variation during the large and sudden immigration surge to Norway after the enlargements of the European labor market in 2004 and 2007. Migrant inflow into occupations is instrumented with occupations’ required level of (Norwegian) language skills. Administrative register data allow for a rich set of individual-level outcomes. Comparing workers in occupations with different language requirements, I find that a one percentage point increase in the share of Eastern European workers reduced native workers’ labor earnings by 0.75 percent. I further find adverse employment effects and evidence of skill-upgrading, but largely no other form of worker mobility among treated individuals. In particular, young woŕkers were hit in the wage dimension and old workers in the employment dimension. The results are highly robust.}

title = {The Wages of Skilled Temporary Migrants: Effects of Visa Pathways and Job Portability},
journal = {International Migration},
volume = {52},
number = {3},
pages = {85-98},
abstract = {Abstract We examine the earnings of highly-skilled foreign, temporary workers and how changes in visa system affect their earnings. We use the National Science Foundation's 2003 National Survey of College Graduates and find that foreign students and temporary workers earn less than natives and permanent immigrant workers on average. Changes in visa status increase earnings, but initial visa status conditions later earnings growth along visa pathways. This implies that migrant workers ability to achieve steady, rather than discontinuous, earnings growth requires policies that make their visa portable, that it permits them to readily change employers. An admission system that favours fully-portable permanent visas may improve worker productivity. The findings also indicate that the selectivity of foreign S\&E students is not as great as that of new workers admitted from abroad; another argument against ‘stapling’ permanent visa status to foreign graduate degrees. Policy Implications Visa requirements do not ensure that temporary students and workers earn the same as similar natives during their initial period of stay. Over time this may depress occupational earnings. There is a need to reform and enforce visa regulations. Visa portability that permits ready changes in employment should better migrant earnings. Permanent admission may be preferred. Temporary foreign students experience slow earnings growth, while temporary workers hired from abroad outperform foreign graduates. The assumption that foreign graduates are the best qualified appears incorrect and facilitating (“stapling”) a green card to their diploma a poor idea.},

journal = {Journal of Labor Economics},
volume = {39},
number = {3},
pages = {639-671},
year = {2021},
    abstract = { One concern regarding US immigration policies is that skilled workers on temporary visas may be bound to their employers in “indentured servitude,” giving rise to monopsony power. I investigate this concern by estimating the effect of acquiring permanent residency on the job mobility and earnings of these workers. Using fixed effects models, I find an immediate upsurge in mobility upon permanent residency receipt, primarily driven by voluntary moving being depressed during the employer-sponsored immigration process. Job lock reduces the earnings of male workers by 4.7\%, which translates to a 2\% surplus for firms after extra hiring costs are subtracted. }
