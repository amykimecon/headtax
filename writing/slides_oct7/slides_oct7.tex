% BACKGROUND
\section{Background}
\begin{frame}{Timeline}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Early 1880s: Influx of Chinese immigrants for construction of Canadian Pacific Railway
        \item 1885: Chinese Exclusion Act institutes \$50 tax
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Only exceptions for students, merchants, and diplomats
            \item Was not applied retroactively, but the tax was required even for re-entry going forward
            \item One-time tax\footnote{Repayment was only required if someone was out of the country for more than 2 years}, applied at the port of entry
            \item Payment was tracked using a physical `head-tax certificate'
            \item Failure to pay would result in being sent back to China -- many immigrants had to borrow money or enter indentured servitude contracts
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Timeline}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1900: Tax raised to \$100 
        \item 1903: Tax raised to \$500 
        \item 1912: All certificates re-issued with a photo (to prevent entry using someone else's certificate)
        \item 1923: Chinese immigration banned completely (with very few exceptions)
        \item Chan (2014) estimates that the Canadian government generated \$23 million in revenue from the Head Tax (approx. 440 million USD today)
    \end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
        \item Canada [1910]: Immigration Act of 1910 further restricts immigration, not expands
        \item Canada [1912]: Head Tax Certificates reissued with photo 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unlikely to have such a massive spike just from using other people's certificates 
        \end{itemize}
        \item China: Republic of China established in 1912 following Xinhai Revolution (1911)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If this is primary cause of spike, would expect some change in regional origin of Chinese immigrants \hyperlink{originchi}{\beamerbutton{Chinese Immigration by Origin by Year}}
            \item Also would not expect to see spike in immigration from other countries \hyperlink{yrimmall}{\beamerbutton{Immigration to Canada from Different Countries}}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Worldwide: WWI begins July 1914
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unclear why most of spike is prior to 1914 -- general global unrest?
